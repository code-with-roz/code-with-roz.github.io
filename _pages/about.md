I am a transport engineer turned data scientist. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Technology in Big Data Science at the University of Pretoria, where the focus of my research is in Machine Learning and NLP (particulary training large language models on African Languages). My expertise lies in solving problems through the process of problem statement formulation, and acquiring, processing, analysing and presenting data. 

# More Information

I was born in Kenya, I have also lived in Tanzania and are currently residing in South Africa. My passions lie in doing impactful work. I am also an avid admirer of self expression and I have recently discovered a love for dance. I love to read and spend most of my downtime scouring through good books (A good story is food for the soul). When I'm not reading I like to go on excurions and connect with nature. All in all a lover of beautiful things and experiences.
