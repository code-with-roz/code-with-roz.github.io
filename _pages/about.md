I'm a transport engineer turned data scientist, and I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Information Technology with a focus on Big Data Science at the University of Pretoria. My research is centered on Machine Learning and NLP, with a particular interest in training large language models on African languages. As a data scientist, I have a strong skillset in problem-solving, including the ability to formulate clear problem statements, acquire, process, and analyze data, and present findings in a meaningful way. I'm excited to continue exploring the field of data science and using my skills to solve important problems.

### More about me

I'm originally from Kenya, but I've also spent time living in Tanzania. Currently, I'm living in South Africa. I'm passionate about making a positive impact through my work, and I'm a big believer in self expression. Recently, I've discovered a love for dance and I'm really enjoying it. In my free time, I love reading and immersing myself in a good book. I believe a great story nourishes the soul. When I'm not reading, I love going on nature excursions and exploring the great outdoors. Overall, I'm a lover of all things beautiful and meaningful experiences.
