title: Customer Segmentation in the Public Transport Sector in South Africa
categories: [Engineering]

Customer segmentation is the process of determining the different customer groups that exist in a market with the aim of defining the group characteristics and thereafter determining the points of potential growth within the segments that will lead to increased market share[3,4,7].

Understanding the different customer segments in the South African public transport system would allow for the implementation of a transport system that would be user responsive and thus (possibly) increase the market share of public transport users[2].

Previous studies have proposed methods such as carrying out face‑to-face surveys, or observational surveys that involve questionnaires that commuters answer, of which the results are analysed and clustered to identify the different customer segments[1,3,4,7]. These methods have however proven ineffective in the South African context given the fragmented nature of the public transport user market[2]. Clark and Crous (2002) proposed the method of State Preference surveys instead that involves having users choose between different components of a service to determine which parts of the service are most important to users. In the case of public transport, these components would be ticket pricing, reliability, safety, convenience etc.[2,5]

The current state of the public transport sector in South Africa can be described as deplorable. The industry is plagued with accounts of mismanagement within the service provider entities and users are forced to use a system plagued with aging infrastructure, crime, and general unsafety[2]. This makes public transport extremely unattractive as a means of transport, therefore unless a commuter is a captive user, most commuters opt for other alternative means of transport. This has given the public transport industry the perception that it is a “poor man’s means” with a one-size fits all approach taken by service providers when it comes to service provision[2,7].

Improving the public transport system in South Africa would require extensive investment in improving the Quality of Service (QoS), that would in turn improve the functionality of the system. Improving the QoS involves improving service reliability, operational safety, information dissemination, and infrastructure and rolling stock conditions[2,3,4,5,7]. Given the deprioritisation of public transport in South Africa, increased resource allocation is unlikely to occur because other sectors such as healthcare and education are considered a higher priority. There is already a reduction in the subsidies provided by government to the bus and rail sector and this trajectory is expected to continue in the long‑term[2].

Given this challenge, increasing the market share of commuters using public transport would require innovative solutions that go beyond improving the QoS. Solutions that also elevate the user experience as they interact with the system should be investigate solutions.  Camacho et al. (2016) proposed focusing on the users’ experiential journey through the system by conducting qualitative research and embracing an interdisciplinary approach in solution development[6,7].

Therefore, developing the customer ecosystem within the South African public transport system would require bridging the gap between the service providers and customer experience. This can be achieved by implementing a combination of research methodologies that are not only centered on improving QoS, but that also explore the experiential journey of the customer to determine definite customer segments that would dictate the most effective improvement strategy to be implemented.
